# Oversampling-with-Genetic-Algorithm
## synthesize new data with genetic approach
#### Genetic algorithm is a great approach to synthesize new samples. We can use this algorithm instead of the adopted method. For fitness-function,  I use logistic regression. logistic regression set the probability to each sample and due to the probability, we choose chromosomes randomly. 
with uniform Crossover, we combine chromosomes to synthesize new chromosomes and in the end, we select the best chromosome with the most probability that shows it's related to the minority target.
